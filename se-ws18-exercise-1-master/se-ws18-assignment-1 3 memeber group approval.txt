Hello Syju,

I'a bit disappointed you didn't ask earlier. I will accept your 3-person
submission for this first assignment only, but I will reassign you to a
different group afterwards.

Regards, F. Echtler

Respected Sir,

I am an enrolled student of your Software Engineering subject in this winter
semester. For the first assignment of software engineering, I have worked and
completed it along with two more members with me and is ready for submission
now. So I wish to submit the same in GitHub as a group of three members with
your kind approval.
Kindly approve the same and do the needful.


Thanks and Regards,
